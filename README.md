# app-list-for-homebridge-smartglass

This list is meant to be a simple copy and paste solution for the [homebridge-smartglass](https://github.com/unknownskl/homebridge-smartglass) plugin. As [Microsoft ended support for Smartglass](https://twitter.com/majornelson/status/998790240377565184) the Title ID in listTable.txt is just a nice to have but apps won't be launchable anymore.

## You can help expanding the list

On your Xbox it is pretty easy.

1st navigate to the app or game you want to add<br />

4th extracth the information. Preferrably add it to the lists as a pull request but an issue with a screenshot will work, too.<br />
